Welcome to our final project for CEE 4200 Water Resources Management taught by Stefano Galelli at Cornell University!

This project consists of looking at the 2014-2016 drought in Brazil and adjusting the outflows of the reservoirs into SPMR to adapt the system better when there is a drought. This was done using a genetic algorithm made in Python using deap and several other modules. You can find these files in the repository. Within this readme file, we will go over what each of the files is and how to use them!

## Before we start

The files that we use are in the form of .ipynb, they can be run using an IDE, if there are packages that you do not have here are the commands that should give you everything that you need to run the files

  pip install deap \
  pip install pandas\
  pip install matplotlib\
  pip install numpy\
  pip install plotly\
  pip install random\
