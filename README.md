# Welcome to our final project for CEE 4200 Water Resources Management taught by Stefano Galelli at Cornell university!

#   this project consists of looking at the 2014-2016 drought that happened in brazil and adjusting the outflows \
#   of the resevoirs into SPMR to better adapt the system when there is a drought, this was done using a genetic \
#   algorithm that was made in python using a deap and a number of other modules, you can find these files in the 
#   repository, within this readme file we will go over what each of the files are how to use them!
